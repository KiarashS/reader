                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a little while now and I&#x27;m curious what would be the right approach to build a model that can identify a sketch. I have no clue about neural nets or machine learning, except for linear reg and gradient descent which I played around with when I was 16 but that&#x27;s about it and it&#x27;s been many years.
 The reason I want to do that is because sketching is a hobby of mine and I want to be able to click a picture of the sketch and have a model rate it. So I want to know where I should start. 
 - Do I build a neural net from scratch? Or do I use an existing model and train it?
 - What framework should I look into?

                              <span>Hey. I&#x27;m a Supply Chain Analytics masters student, and have begun using Python for data analysis. It&#x27;s all new to me. Are there any tutoring platforms for computer science that people use? Similar to Italki, Preply etc.? One-to-one learning!
 Thanks for any tips!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a graduated computer science engineer and i have a solid background with ML and my graduation project was a reasearch on adversarial Machine Learning in NLP. But since the graduation i didn&#x27;t work on any ML related topics, so i kinda forgot many things, i want to reproduce a paper to refresh my memory and also get more hands-on work because i want to do work to be included in my resume as well. My question is, is reproducing a paper the right choice for me right now? If so then what papers could i start with (l&#x27;m open for any thing in ML either CV, NLP Multimodal, generative models,..etc literally anything is fine with me as long as i will gain more knowledge and experience). And if not then what are your suggestions for what i should do instead?

                              <span>I have recently started to get in to ML/DL. I can understand concepts and ideas. But whenever i am going through a repository I have issues following the data flows (trying to understand how data is moving around the model). Especially data transformations/ reshaping that keep happening. How does one think about these more intuitively? How did you overcome this struggle in your initial days. What was your journey with these problems?

Please suggest if there is any appropriate model for this.

 I&#x27;ve been trying to understand how to detect an overfitting model, but the explanations I&#x27;ve come across are often overly complex. I know that it&#x27;s easy to spot an underfitting model when metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1 score are low, for example, around 0.5 in a classification model. But how do you detect overfitting using this approach? Or perhaps you use another method?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently working with a pre-trained ViT (ViT_B_16) for downstream tasks. I&#x27;m in the process of fine-tuning it with approximately 13,000 images distributed across 100 classes. My approach involves following PyTorch official tutorials and conducting training on a Cloud Tesla T4 (g4dn.8xlarge). Each epoch takes around 14 minutes, and for the initial run, I&#x27;ve arbitrarily set 20 epochs.
 For additional context, my model specifications include a batch size of 32, and I&#x27;m utilizing an Adam optimizer with a learning rate set to 1e-3. I have a few questions:
  
Is a 14-minute duration per epoch reasonable?
 Are there ways to decrease the training duration? Would you suggest a linear learning rate scheduler, increasing the batch size, or adjusting the DataLoader number of workers?
 Did I overlook anything by not incorporating weight decay, epsilon, or betas?
  
I&#x27;m feeling a bit anxious about the setup and would greatly appreciate any advice.
 Many thanks for your time.

                              <span>I really enjoy learning about finance and I&#x27;ve been wanting to apply my machine learning on a project in that field. I understand that time-series forecasting of stocks and such has been done billions of times, and that there are algorithms which simplify that task a lot, so for both of those reasons my project would be pointless. I really wanted to do something related to this segment, but any way i turn i end up bumping my head into &quot;too simple&quot; or &quot;not a good concept&quot; for ML.
 Any ideas? I&#x27;m really all out of luck.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of beginner tutorials to implement video stream based sign language recognition but they all seem to have some issues in a real world situation (Let&#x27;s say a TV recording of a press conference).
 A client asked if we can do this, so I started wondering:
  
How good is the current state of the are for SLR really? Is it being used in practice?
 Are there existing models or even services that can just be used?
 Do these exist or can be adopted for less popular sign language dialects?

                              <span>Hello, I am especially interested in learning more about the field of data science. This includes learning about all the fundamentals from algorithms and underlying mathmatical theories to types of machine learning. I want to use python since i find it easy to use and i will be using it at work a lot soon. What i am missing right now is the ability to think of problems i can solve. By that i mean small easy projects to learn the basics. I feel like i need to be guided through this learning process just like i am being guided in class at my university. Which courses can you recommend? What did they teach you? What would you describe the learning process to be like?

 I know that it&#x27;s an extremely specific situation, just because ML testing is the job that Engineer does with the training and after.
 So my question is: do you have any experience with QA application directly in ML projects, or related literature to start?

 Abstract:
  
Current language models fall short in understanding aspects of the world not easily described in words, and struggle with complex, long-form tasks. Video sequences offer valuable temporal information absent in language and static images, making them attractive for joint modeling with language. Such models could develop a understanding of both human textual knowledge and the physical world, enabling broader AI capabilities for assisting humans. However, learning from millions of tokens of video and language sequences poses challenges due to memory constraints, computational complexity, and limited datasets. To address these challenges, we …</span>

                              <span>I built a system that lets you take a photo of a bookshelf and create an interactive HTML web page where you can click on books in an image to learn more about each one.
 The tech stack for this project is:
  
Grounded SAM to retrieve polygons for books.
 OpenCV + supervision transformations to prepare books for OCR.
 GPT-4 with Vision for OCR
 Google Books API to get book metadata.
 HTML + SVG generation to create the final web page.
  
I wrote about how I built this project on my blog.
 Try the demo.
 I&#x27;d love feedback on how I can improve the book detection rate for better performance. Training a custom segmentation model on book spines might work, but I am cognizant about how much data I might need for that.
 The red polygons below indicate segmented books that, in the demo, are clickable:

 RAG in it&#x27;s simplest form is a vector search as context with a LLM prompt.
 With the next version of txtai, we&#x27;ll have a series of new graph-based RAG techniques. Think of this like a road trip with a number of pit stops.
 Say you&#x27;re researching the early medieval history of England. Sure we can run a vector search for that. But what if we can instruct a query to traverse a number of concepts we&#x27;re interested in?
 Let&#x27;s take the example above. This is a network of Wikipedia articles (via txtai-wikipedia). The query traverses paths of history between the Roman Empire, Anglo-Saxon period, Viking period and ends with the Norman conquest. This rich dataset is then available as a library of context to downstream LLM prompts.
 Graph databases aren&#x27;t new. The difference here is that txtai builds a vector store and uses that to automatically build a graph network weighted by vector similarity.

                              <span>I have an embeddings dataset consisting of some clusters of data points (I chose a priori which points belong to the same cluster). Currently, points belonging to the same cluster aren&#x27;t necessarily close to each other in embedding space. I want to find a low-dimensional subspace such that if I project these embeddings onto that subspace, points belonging the same cluster will be close to each other. Different clusters don&#x27;t necessarily need to be far apart in the low-dim space. I thought of an optimization problem to solve using SVD and the k-means cost function, but not sure if I can actually solve it. Was curious if anyone else has ideas/thoughts!

                              <span>I have 3 hours high quality dataset with and the model will be used to do the same thing the dataset is from. My question is How many epoches should i let it run for and if i should cut down the dataset. 
 Also what is the difference between using 10, 10 second audio to make a voice and making my own entire model.
 i will be using the same dataset to train an RVC model, my plan is to run the tortoise output through the same model in RVC toupscale the quality and later further enhance it with adobe enhance.
 I would be grateful if someone knowledgeable on this topic helped me out because i am completey new to this, Thank you.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a graduated computer science engineer, and i have a solid background with ML . My graduation project was research on adversarial machine learning in NLP. But since the graduation i didn&#x27;t work on any ML related topics, so i kinda forgot many things, i want to reproduce a paper to refresh my memory and also get more hands-on work because i want to do thing to be included in my resume as well. My question is, is reproducing a paper the right choice for me right now? If so then what papers could i start with (I&#x27;m open for any thing in ML either CV, NLP, Multimodal, generative models, ..etc literally anything is fine with me as long as i will gain more knowledge and experience). And if not, then what are your suggestions for what i should do instead?

I prefer reading or watching a material, where author is writing code not using ready RNN functions and is explaining everything in details like Andrej Karpathy would. (I read Karpathy&#x27;s blog post on RNN, but there was no much code related to RNNs and article was mostly about LSTMs)

                              <span>Hey guys, I’m not sure this is the right space to ask this type of question. I’m kinda new on this so sorry if it’s not.
 Yesterday I started trying to create a script that detects some sort of category in some provided images. However in order to train the model I saw that I could download a lot of photos, with the detections already done from Open Images Dataset. However I don’t seem to find any way to download all the photos (or at least a good amount) from a specific category (airplanes for example). 
 Does anyone who knows how to work with this type of project can help me? Thank you a lot.

                              <span>Straight to the point: 
 is it possible for the latent space of a VAE to learn a classification not fed to the model? As an example let’s say you had a bunch of images of cats and dogs together, no labels, could a VAE model learn implicitly whether it’s a cat or a dog via the latent space?
 As another question, could you use the loss of a VAE in tandem with a classification model and use the loss of the VAE to gauge the likelihood that a sample is one of the labels in the first place?

                              <span>Hello. 
 I work on a system that is highly parameterized i.e. has a high number of parameters (binary values or a range of integers). These parameters are not independent. Although a lot of the possible combinations are not valid, they still result in a very high number of possible configurations. 
 Now, the task at hand is to find the best configuration of this parameterized system that will maximize a metric that is directly measurable, subject to the input setting. Again the input space is non-trivially large. 
 It seems like a classical machine learning problem but seems more of a simulation-type problem where given an ideal world where I have infinite resources, I would run all system configurations against the input setting in question and find the setting that maximizes my metric in question. In “test time”, I will use this information in hand to run the system in the most optimal setting. 
 Does this problem setting sound close to any existing well-researched area? Thanks. 
 PS - I am being cryptic as I am not in a position to disclose the exact system in question.

The objective is to make a chatbot or virtual agent. However, after finetuning, instead of a single response, the model generates an entire conversation. My prompt looks something like - 
 Conversation :

 Agent :

 Should I change the prompt? Does anyone have any experience on finetuning on chat/transcript data? Any help would be highly appreciated.

                              <span>The following “needle in a haystack” test for GPT 4 went viral earlier this year, showing 100% retrieval for the first 64k tokens:
 https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack
 Is this considered a valid test among machine learning experts? If it is valid, then has it been replicated anywhere else? It seems unlikely that this would be the only public implementation of the test if it was valid.
 If it is not valid, what method might be?
 Finally, overall how many tokens of context do you personally think GPT 4 can remember well?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious to learn more about using knowledge graphs in retrieve-and-generate (RAG) systems. RAG involves retrieving external knowledge to help generate responses, so it seems like knowledge graphs could be very useful.
 Some specific questions I have:
  
What types of knowledge graphs work best for RAG applications? Do domain-specific graphs tend to be more useful compared to large, general graphs?
 What are some effective techniques for querying and retrieving relevant knowledge from graphs to generate responses? Are there any best practices?
 How feasible is it to keep knowledge graphs updated as new information emerges? Does the graph need to be static or can RAG systems handle frequent graph updates?
 Can knowledge graphs help with tasks like disambiguation of entities and concepts when generating responses?
 Are there any good open source knowledge graphs out there that can be pre-trained with RAG models? Or examples of systems that showcase using graphs well?
  
I&#x27;d appreciate any insight you can offer around integrating knowledge graphs into RAG workflows. Feel free to point me to any papers, examples, or other materials too. Looking forward to learning more about this area.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently working with a pre-trained ViT (ViT_B_16) for downstream tasks. I&#x27;m in the process of fine-tuning it with approximately 13,000 images distributed across 100 classes. My approach involves following PyTorch official tutorials and conducting training on a Cloud Tesla T4 (g4dn.8xlarge). Each epoch takes around 14 minutes, and for the initial run, I&#x27;ve arbitrarily set 20 epochs.
 For additional context, my model specifications include a batch size of 32, and I&#x27;m utilizing an Adam optimizer with a learning rate set to 1e-3. I have a few questions:
  
Is a 14-minute duration per epoch reasonable?
 Are there ways to decrease the training duration? Would you suggest a linear learning rate scheduler, increasing the batch size, or adjusting the DataLoader number of workers?
 Did I overlook anything by not incorporating weight decay, epsilon, or betas?
  
I&#x27;m feeling a bit anxious about the setup and would greatly appreciate any advice.
 Many thanks for your time.

 Some of the use cases can be long queries, maintaining long context, spelling mistakes, handling multiple conditions, rewriting, expansion, query intent , NLU.
 I will probably build it using RAG+LLM but I think the basic principles will still apply. Any suggestions on where/what to read up?

I&#x27;m a developer advocate at Determined AI and am always looking to learn new things, so I wanted to work through it myself. Super well written blog post by u/ExaminationNo8522 helped too.
 Anyways, I wanted to go through it and reproduce for myself on a different dataset, and port to Determined. The result is a beginner friendly notebook + blog post. Check these out if you&#x27;re interested.
 And of course, let me know if you have thoughts/feedback/comments/issues!

                              <span>Hi r/MachineLearning,
 ​
 I have recently been training a custom YOLOv5 dataset for a project I am working on. I notice that when I run train.py, initially the system loads up my RAM with what I assume are the model weights before running the training? 
 ​
 I say this because my GPU has near-zero usage for the first minute or so while my RAM usage goes from baseline to almost 16 GB used by Vscode. Is this normal behavior? I am running the YOLOv5m pretrained weights which is a 21.2 M parameter model. GPU memory usage peaks at around 8.3 GB/12 GB. 
 ​
 I am training on 1280x1280 px images and a batch size of 4. The larger images are required for my application as I need to identify small features. The batch size is limited by my GPU memory as far as I can tell. 
 ​
 Just wanted to see if anyone else has seen this or if the high RAM usage points to some inefficiency or memory leak.
 ​
 Thanks!
 ​

                              <span>Hi I am trying to build a modularized LLM application using Langchain where within any individual conversation the app can seamless switch between multiple LLMs to respond to the query, for example:
  
User: What&#x27;s 1+ 1?
 App (GPT-3.5): 1+1 is 2
 User: Concatenate the last name of the current president of the US with the answer from your last response
 App (Gemini Ultra): Biden2
  
I have two technical questions that I hope this subreddit can help answer:
  
What&#x27;s the standard practice for setting the initialization prompts or background prompts? For example I want to tell this App that &quot;your name is Bob&quot;, and I want this App to continuously remember it&#x27;s Bob regardless how long the conversation has gotten or any switching between LLMs. Do I set this at the beginning of the conversation or before every single response?
 What&#x27;s the standard practice for conversation memory management when there&#x27;s switching of LLM involved within one conversation? Do I store all the conversation history within a vector database and do a index search prior to any individual response?

 Abstract:
  
Diffusion models have gained attention in text processing, offering many potential advantages over traditional autoregressive models. This work explores the integration of diffusion models and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a well-established technique to improve the reasoning ability in autoregressive language models. We propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), allowing reasoning steps to diffuse over time through the diffusion process. In contrast to traditional autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT offers more flexibility in the trade-off between computation and reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication and grade school math problems. Additionally, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning capabilities in diffusion language models.

 Code: https://github.com/llm-random/llm-random
 Abstract:
  
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a primary solution for reducing the computational cost of Large Language Models. In this work, we analyze their scaling properties, incorporating an expanded range of variables. Specifically, we introduce a new hyperparameter, granularity, whose adjustment enables precise control over the size of the experts. Building on this, we establish scaling laws for fine-grained MoE, taking into account the number of training tokens, model size, and granularity. Leveraging these laws, we derive the optimal training configuration for a given computational budget. Our findings not only show that MoE models consistently outperform dense Transformers but also highlight that the efficiency gap between dense and MoE models widens as we scale up the model size and training budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the common practice of setting the size of experts in MoE to mirror the feed-forward layer is not optimal at almost any computational budget.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve hundreds of transcripts having conversations between agent and customer. I&#x27;ve been working on finetuning mistral using QLoRa. The objective is to make a chatbot or virtual agent. However, after finetuning, instead of a single response, the model generates an entire conversation. My prompt looks something like - 
 Conversation :
 {A Small Snippet from a Transcript}
 Agent :
 { }
 Should I change the prompt? Does anyone have any experience on finetuning on chat/transcript data? Any help would be highly appreciated.

 Abstract:
  
Diffusion models have gained attention in text processing, offering many potential advantages over traditional autoregressive models. This work explores the integration of diffusion models and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a well-established technique to improve the reasoning ability in autoregressive language models. We propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), allowing reasoning steps to diffuse over time through the diffusion process. In contrast to traditional autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT offers more flexibility in the trade-off between computation and reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication and grade school math problems. Additionally, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning capabilities in diffusion language models.

                              <span>Hi! I have this dilemma right now. I&#x27;m currently working as a Computer Vision engineer in my company. Unfortunately, the majority of my tasks do not include any Computer vision, and it&#x27;s often some code tasks or creating algorithms of how to automatically control robot with PID controllers and stuff. However, there are sometimes Computer Vision tasks such as using opencv trackers. That said, its important to notice, that I can have my time learning different stuff while working and nobody really pushes me there.
 I&#x27;ve also joined an ML internship in another company. The project I&#x27;m working on there is EDA analysis for tabular data. By the end of this internship, I will probably get an offer from the company, but I dont know whether Im gonna be working with Computer Vision.
 That said, Im currently in a situation, where, due to my university, I must choose between them. It&#x27;s important to note that I want to grow as a Computer Vision developer. What should I choose between my job and internship? Can I become a Strong Junior dev just by searching and learning stuff from books and pet-projects?

Please suggest if there is any appropriate model for this.

                              <span>In order to do image processing on large or irregularly shaped images one strategy is to divide the input image into patches, say 64x64 pixels. How do you reassemble those patches into a large image again after inference? Obviously you can just concatenate them, but that would risk edges where the patches meet. Sliding windows with overlap and averaging can result in blurring. This is less of a problem when doing segmentation, but what about other image processing?
 If you&#x27;re doing super resolution or style transfer or anything that results in a new natural image, how would you merge patches back into a full size image? Are there any standard ways of doing it, or even comparisons between multiple methods?
 I tried searching, but all I can find is how to split images into patches, not the other way around.

Differential privacy (DP) is a property of randomized mechanisms that limit the influence of any individual user’s information while processing and analyzing data. DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations. Researchers have recently found errors in the mathematical proofs of private mechanisms, and their implementations. For example, researchers compared six sparse vector technique (SVT) variations and found that only two…</span>

 In my family, we have this special kind of music and singing that is from a really small part in Europe, and I really want to keep it safe for the future and experiment with on an AI/LLM model (I don’t know that exact name).
 Is there any kind of model where I can teach it to use our voices and music, so I can make songs with it using my and family’s own voice and our music?
 Many thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to deploy a simple app on an ESP32-S3 microcontroller that can identify when a cat meowing is heard. How feasible is that? How would you suggest I approach it?
 TensorFlow has TinyML, but it seems to be a lot of work to get it running on edge devices like the ESP32. Is that really the best option?
 TIA, -T

                              <span>I am trying to access my Huggingface space through a Postman request. When I copy the exported curl command, it looks like this:
  curl --location &#x27;https://MY_SPACE_NAME_HERE.hf.space/--replicas/RANDOMDIGITS/&#x27; \ --header &#x27;Content-Type: application/json&#x27; \ --header &#x27;Authorization: Bearer hf_REST_OF_MY_TOKEN_HERE&#x27; \ --data &#x27;{&quot;data&quot;: [&quot;data:image/jpeg;base64,PIC_IN_BASE64_HERE&quot;]}&#x27;  
 But when I run this request, I get:
  { &quot;detail&quot;: &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot; }  
 How do get this request to succeed? 
 Also my API endpoint works perfectly when I access it via the boilerplate python code that Gradio gives me. Do you know what the problem is?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am immensely confused about how to train Tesseract for OCR with just images + txts. It suppossedly works, but I can&#x27;t get it to work.
 Does anyone here have experience with it and could provide me with some help / an example on how to use it properly? I know there is some stuff on the GitHub repo, but (as I said) it&#x27;s really confusing to me on how to actually use it.
 Any help is highly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am on a Mac M1 and want to do model training on images, obviously no GPU. Last time I tried it took me forever just for a few iterations, when for good results I&#x27;d need minimum 400k and ideally more than a 1 million.
 I was interested into cloud computing solutions, but when I looked at the pricing (e.g. google cloud tensorflow) my wallet started to shake unexplainably.
 Do any of you have any recommendation in terms of what are the best options out there for my purpose?

 I am writing a paper with my PhD supervisor and it has been noted that these values add up to 101%.
 Am I misunderstanding what this represents or should it be 100%?
 Thank you for any information you may be able to provide.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m a machine learning student trying to help friends who are organizing a festival.
 There will be around 300 volunteers and I thought I could automate the planning wich take a lot of time.
 There are different stands where volunteers are placed and this spread over two days : Friday and Saturday.
 Each volunteer chose their three favorite stands in an order of preference from a list.
 Here the file Pole.xlsx with the name of each stand in color
 They also indicate the people they would like to be with with the format :
 BARACK Obama, BARACK Obama, BARACK Obama, ...
 So quite a few conditions... I get an Excel extraction of the first answers.
 Here are the headers of the file I keep : 
 Inscriptions.xlsx
 I&#x27;ve already tried to do it with a greedy algorithm and Gale Shapley but I can&#x27;t achieve much.
 Do you have any ideas for accomplishing this task ? 
 Thanks in advance.

My dept is encouraging me to take a course or tutorial/workshop and I want to use the opportunity to learn more in the ML space. Wondering if there were any good workshops in person you all know of? I’ve got a baseline understanding and have taken ML coursework, but would love to find a workshop / week long course that deep dives into an area or multiple areas of ML.

 Beginner Here - i uploaded a snippet of the dataset 
 Am trying to create the infamous price prediction model for houses.
 I uploaded my dataset, reduced some data columns, splitted the independent variables and the target variable, then split them into train and test datasets, detected(using histograms and boxplots) and deleted some outliers, scaled the features, and label encoded the non-numerical data [ oneHotEncoding is impossible because of TOO MANY unique values] and finally trained my model - linear regression using Sklearn.
 I scaled the test independent variables and I got an R2 score of about 0.2 and a high MAE score.
 Problem: I can&#x27;t understand why the score are bad. The steps of the model training are correct. So probably the data preprocessing is wrong. I tried other model training such as knn regression and random forest regression but ended up with bad results. 
 More details:
 - Deleted &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Province&quot; columns since I have longitude and latitude.
 - Label encoded &quot;Address&quot;. Removing does not do anything and I think it should not be removed as the prices changes drastically between different values of this feature.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently training a neural network for a regression task (to predict prices in housing dataset). I have been testing out different parameter combinations on my network but noticed something a bit weird. When training my model, the first epoch always as an abnormal large value that suddenly decreases by a lot:
 Epoch 1/20 loss: 0.4525 - mse: 0.4508 - val_loss: 0.1827 - val_mse: 0.0653
 Epoch 2/20 - loss: 0.1556 - mse: 0.0618 - val_loss: 0.1367 - val_mse: 0.0552 
 Epoch 3/20 loss: 0.1451 - mse: 0.0577 - val_loss: 0.1396 - val_mse: 0.0592 
 Epoch 4/20 loss: 0.1455 - mse: 0.0581 - val_loss: 0.1369 - val_mse: 0.0564 
 Epoch 5/20 loss: 0.1289 - mse: 0.0497 - val_loss: 0.0932 - val_mse: 0.0422 
 Epoch 6/20 - loss: 0.1300 - mse: 0.0502 - val_loss: 0.1053 - val_mse: 0.0482 
 Epoch 7/20 - loss: 0.1255 - mse: 0.0476 - val_loss: 0.1056 - val_mse: 0.0454 
 Epoch 8/20 - loss: 0.1271 - mse: 0.0482 - val_loss: 0.1416 - val_mse: 0.0537 
 Epoch 9/20 - loss: 0.1279 - mse: 0.0489 - val_loss: 0.1217 - val_mse: 0.0507 
 Epoch 10/20 - loss: 0.1232 - mse: 0.0489 - val_loss: 0.1232 - val_mse: 0.0464 
 I have tried batch normalization, dropout, learning_rate and do not see any improvements.
 My issue here is when looking at the plots of the train and validation loss i am unable to clearly see the difference between both metrics. I believe my model is appropriate for the data but i am unable to reduce that single first epoch any ideas? I have bellow the metrics that i have for both train and test. In this scenario should I not emphasize this plot as much? Thank you

                              <span>I have faqs and answers .when ever user asks question related to the faq the bot should give response.the faq size is very huge.Iam new to ML.iam thinking of implementing classification model with feed forward neural network.I will create some sample questions for a faq and create a class for each question.is this model feasible when the data is huge ?. Please suggest if there is any appropriate model for this.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am immensely confused about how to train Tesseract for OCR with just images + txts. It suppossedly works, but I can&#x27;t get it to work.
 Does anyone here have experience with it and could provide me with some help / an example on how to use it properly? I know there is some stuff on the GitHub repo, but (as I said) it&#x27;s really confusing to me on how to actually use it.
 Any help is highly appreciated!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a newcomer to transformers and have a question about multi-head usage. I&#x27;ve gathered from various blogs that it helps capture word importance in different contexts. For instance, with 2 heads and a token size of 516, the embeddings split into two parts processed separately. If a word like &#x27;king&#x27; represents gender and royalty in different dimensions, having them in separate halves enables the model to learn both aspects. However, if gender and royalty are in the same half, can the model still discern their importance individually, or is it limited to focusing on one aspect at a time?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 In 2023, many sophisticated open-source LLMs have become available. However, integrating these AI models into a production environment continues to be a complex task. I made an article that will guide you through deploying some of the top LLMs, namely LLaMA 2 70B, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B, on AWS EC2. I employ an inference engine capable of batch processing and distributed inference: vLLM.
 vLLM will greatly aid in the implementation of LLaMA 2 and Mixtral because it allows us to use AWS EC2 instances equipped with multiple smaller GPUs (such as the NVIDIA A10) rather than relying on a single large GPU (like the NVIDIA A100 or H100).
 See the detailed how-to here: https://nlpcloud.com/deploy-llama-2-mistral-and-mixtral-on-aws-ec2-with-vllm.html
 In this tutorial I used AWS EC2 but I could have used other vendors of course. The main challenge is the cost of the GPUs and their availability.
 Please don&#x27;t hesitate to share feedbacks about this article, it will be very much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;m still a beginner. I want to ask what&#x27;s wrong in my code that the resulted model didn&#x27;t classify the apple leaf diseases correctly? the code run without error when I run the code, but the disease clasification is false. I trained this on 7k images apple leaves diseases dataset with 4 classes, each class has images around 1.8k. The total images of each class is not equal, is this affect the model clasification? or is there something wrong in my code below?

                              <span>guys can you suggest a reference or tutorial series or a book for machine learning ? my college professors sometimes don&#x27;t explain what they are writing, like I understood the k-means algo , all the theory they taught but I am confused about polynomial regression and what is regularized linear regression
 a book or a reference site maybe helpful
 thanks for the upcoming answers !

                              <span>I went through some courses where there&#x27;s only theory and not practical work, like CS229 and Deepmind UCL Intro to RL, and I feel like I haven&#x27;t learnt a thing. I tkae notes of everything shown in slides, written on boards but don&#x27;t understand them at all. I miss what they are talking about/expaining and my notes makes no sense to me.
 I feel like I&#x27;d have learnt more if I just sat down and listened to what they said while looking at their displayed slides. I don&#x27;t actually need these notes since I don&#x27;t review them, for an exam or something else unlike I would in irl courses.

                              <span>I understand how revolutionary the transformer architecture is. However, while studying it, it&#x27;s crazy how much details this thing contains, which makes it harder for everyone to understand/enhance.
 My question is, have there been any attempts to build a simplified transformer architecture? something akin to how GRUs are kind of a simplified version of LSTMs. 
 Would really appreciate it if you could point me to any papers that have tried to accomplish that, or maybe find any unnecessary/less necessary elements in the original 2017 paper.

                              <span>From what I understand, after a data scientist hands me the models binaries, I should load it into Pytorch. Then I create endpoints our client can call. The input of the client is placed through transformers, then fed into the model which spits out a prediction. I then return the prediction in the HTTP response.
 Is this done in any regular ol&#x27; CPU cloud VM like a Digital Ocean droplet? Or should I use deploy the model separately in a Paperspace GPU and call it from a Flask server in a droplet? The details are quite fuzzy for me on this.

                              <span>I’m reading the book “Math for Machine Learning” and there’s a Linear Algebra section that focuses on solving linear equations (reduced row echelon form, elementary transformations, calculating the inverse). How applicable is this to learning ML. Should I actually solve these linear equations by hand to prepare to understand ML?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 u/NeetCode and I are excited to announce coding problems for AI/ML that you can solve in your browser and run against test cases. They assume no prior background knowledge in AI/ML. They work up from linear regression to coding and training a GPT chat model from scratch!
 For each problem, I also created a 5-10 minute background video covering the concepts needed to solve the problem (or quiz, for the topics that have multiple choice quizzes to go along with them) as well as a solution video.
 All the videos for the problems, and 2x a week concept overviews on different ML topics (suggestions welcome!) can be found on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@GPTandChill
 The problem list can be found here on NeetCode&#x27;s site https://neetcode.io/practice?subpage&#x3D;practice&amp;tab&#x3D;coreSkills&amp;topic&#x3D;Machine%20Learning OR here on my site https://www.gptandchill.ai/leetcode-for-ml
 And here are Navi&#x27;s posts for some additional context:

                              <span>I am following the basic tutorial https://docs.gpytorch.ai/en/stable/examples/01_Exact_GPs/Simple_GP_Regression.html to train a Gaussian Process for the following data
 train_x is a tensor of [4058, 12] train_y is a tensor of [4058, 140] 
 I get an error calculating the loss
 loss &#x3D; -mll(output, train_y) 
 saying that output(model(train_x)) and train_ydon&#x27;t have the same dimension. Given this, I tried MultitaskGPModelhttps://docs.gpytorch.ai/en/stable/examples/03_Multitask_Exact_GPs/Multitask_GP_Regression.html getting a very similar error
 RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (568120) must match the size of tensor b (8116) at non-singleton dimension 0 
 Apparently MultitaskGPModelrequires the same total number of entries to be equal. Is there a way to train a multiple-entry GP?

                              <span>Hello people. I&#x27;ve been thinking about how a model like Stable Diffusion trained on immense amounts of data could be used to detect anomalies in images in a zero-shot manner. For example, detecting folds and tears in old photos:
 https://preview.redd.it/wqlhl516deic1.png?width&#x3D;663&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;e90deb650443f4d0f8c32e3d01d6c9b1941a21d9
 I know there are many works which use SD to inpaint the damaged areas given a mask; but what if we don&#x27;t have the mask? There are also approaches such as the very cool DiffEdit, where we can use language to localise areas affected the most by a text prompt; but what about the cases where language just isn&#x27;t precise enough? 
 If any images can be inverted to SD&#x27;s latent space, could the inverted latents tell us something useful about how to detect the damage? Or are there any other properties of either the model or the defects which can be leveraged? Are there any works which try to leverage the distribution learned by SD* to detect the areas which should be inpainted? 
 *My intuition is that while SD has definitely been trained on images like this, the presence of deterioration is often not described precisely in language, i.e. this image&#x27;s caption may be something along the lines of &quot;old photo&quot;, and the folds are only one of the attributes which &quot;old photo&quot; will cover, another one being the sepia tone for example. 
 Any pointers and discussion are appreciated!

 Do I have to change the visibility manually?

 Currently I am searching for a topic for my dissertation and I was thinking going for machine vision,
 my idea here is to apply ML to identify drugs or ilicit food in x-ray scan images.
 but I am kind of lost on where to start looking for or even if there is data available for training.
 any help is appreciated

                              <span>Suppose you generate embeddings using two different pre-trained encoders. Is there a way I can leverage these two types of embeddings to get an improved clustering of the data? Is there a term for this, or some prior literature I can read?

                              <span>We all know that machine learning scene is dominated by Python, simple, yet slow language. From my experience languages like Rust, C++, C and Zig are on average 10x faster (it may vary a LOT of course, and the use of C-written modules doesn&#x27;t help that much for multiple reasons), but they suffer from a need to compile, which takes some time out of development. Still for complex algorithms used in ML they have a clear advantage, once the development process slows down. Why do they have so small market share than? So far I have found literally ONE framework dedicated to run trained NN models called ggml. 
 Edit: I have forgot that TensorFlow is actually, mostly written in c++. So that counters my point about compiled languages not having much market share.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I am making a custom build pc and want to make sure I can use it for ML since I am taking ml courses currently and would also like to train and test my own models. Disclaimer the build was mostly meant for gaming in mind since that is another use case I will be using it for although I am open to changing parts to increase ML effectiveness.
 I am posting here to check if it’s compatible and effective for machine learning. I am open to part swap suggestions as well.

 I am immensely confused about how to train Tesseract for OCR with just images + txts. It suppossedly works, but I can&#x27;t get it to work.
 Does anyone here have experience with it and could provide me with some help / an example on how to use it properly? I know there is some stuff on the GitHub repo, but (as I said) it&#x27;s really confusing to me on how to actually use it.
 Any help is highly appreciated!

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture are showing promising performance on various tasks. However, running them on resource-constrained settings, where GPU memory resources are not abundant, is challenging due to huge model sizes. Existing systems that offload model weights to CPU memory suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU. In this paper, we propose Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference engine with CPU-GPU orchestration for MoE models. The key idea of Fiddler is to use the computation ability of the CPU to minimize the data movement between the CPU and GPU. Our evaluation shows that Fiddler can run the uncompressed Mixtral-8x7B model, which exceeds 90GB in parameters, to generate over 3 tokens per second on a single GPU with 24GB memory, showing an order of magnitude improvement over existing methods.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 In 2023, many sophisticated open-source LLMs have become available. However, integrating these AI models into a production environment continues to be a complex task. I made an article that will guide you through deploying some of the top LLMs, namely LLaMA 2 70B, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B, on AWS EC2. I employ an inference engine capable of batch processing and distributed inference: vLLM.
 vLLM will greatly aid in the implementation of LLaMA 2 and Mixtral because it allows us to use AWS EC2 instances equipped with multiple smaller GPUs (such as the NVIDIA A10) rather than relying on a single large GPU (like the NVIDIA A100 or H100).
 See the detailed how-to here: https://nlpcloud.com/deploy-llama-2-mistral-and-mixtral-on-aws-ec2-with-vllm.html
 In this tutorial I used AWS EC2 but I could have used other vendors of course. The main challenge is the cost of the GPUs and their availability.
 Please don&#x27;t hesitate to share feedbacks about this article, it will be very much appreciated!

                              <span>GStreamer has long been the best framework to build pipelines to handle video streams, and in particular, live ones. Engineers have widely adopted it to build video analytics pipelines, and while many companies have indeed built their machine learning analysis framework around GStreamer, no one had made the effort to contribute upstream, until now.

 Abstract:
  
Autonomous interaction with the computer has been a longstanding challenge with great potential, and the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has markedly accelerated progress in building digital agents. However, most of these agents are designed to interact with a narrow domain, such as a specific software or website. This narrow focus constrains their applicability for general computer tasks. To this end, we introduce OS-Copilot, a framework to build generalist agents capable of interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system (OS), including the web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and various third-party applications. We use OS-Copilot to create FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent for automating general computer tasks. On GAIA, a general AI assistants benchmark, FRIDAY outperforms previous methods by 35%, showcasing strong generalization to unseen applications via accumulated skills from previous tasks. We also present numerical and quantitative evidence that FRIDAY learns to control and self-improve on Excel and Powerpoint with minimal supervision. Our OS-Copilot framework and empirical findings provide infrastructure and insights for future research toward more capable and general-purpose computer agents.

 I&#x27;ve compiled a batch of info in one video, highlighting recent breakthroughs and concrete applications of GNNs in 7 diverse areas.
 GNNs have been making rapid crazy strides recently. Despite much less hype than other AI buzzwords, they have powered numerous achievements in the last year alone.
 I plan to create more content on GNNs, like a short series that will dive into (some) technical details of how GNNs work and more. It would be very helpful to hear your thoughts on this one!

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been working on making LLM evaluations fast by using bayesian optimization to select a sensible subset.
 Bayesian optimization is used because it’s good for exploration / exploitation of expensive black box (paraphrase, LLM).

                              <span>Hello people. I was just messing around to see the behavior for adversarial attacks on image classifiers, and decided to try it with an object detector as well. I noticed that an untargeted adversarial attack on these models yielded some interested masks. The image classifier generated the usually expected noise mask that is popular, but the object detector under the same conditions generated a mask that closely resembles the objects in question. What is the reasoning behind this? Thank you for your help!
 The first picture is the adversarial mask for the object detector, the second one for an image classifier, and the last picture is the original picture.

 So this blog went over most peoples heads but basically it captures a lot more information of words compared to vectors it actually seems like it could potentially be better then vectors when scaled up. It has more dimensionality compared to vectors. Other geometric representations are being looked into as well like triangle space, square space and more to find the optimal geometric encoding for word relationships that might be better at modeling information compared to vectors. It has slight score improvements on some benchmarks so as a proof of concept it really does seem to work. Essentially how it works is it converts words to a fractal style numerical embedding to capture richer information.

 Ironically training was visualized as a fractal recently too so it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising a word2fractal style embedding process was theorized as well.

 I&#x27;m most curious if LangChain is as popular as it was?
 Here&#x27;s mine at a high-level: 
  
 langchain to use OpenAI for creating embeddings
 Pinecone for storing embedding
 langchain to load document splitters and characters splitters for chunking
 Mongo for conversations memory

                              <span>A large fraction of recently released LLMs are using RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm.
 The original RMSNorm paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467.pdf) and most references I&#x27;ve seen argue that RMSNorm is better than LayerNorm because it is much more computationally efficient.
 However, LayerNorm is a tiny fraction of overall compute, so it&#x27;s not clear to me why that speedup would help very much. Asymptotically, LayerNorm is O(d_model), while there are components like the MLP that are O(d_model2 ), or attention that is O(d_model*seq_len + d_model2 ).
 Is it just that the mean centering part of LayerNorm is not all that useful, and so RMSNorm gives you a minor efficiency boost without any important loss in expressivity? Or does RMSNorm have other benefits I&#x27;m not seeing?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 In 2023, many sophisticated open-source LLMs have become available. However, integrating these AI models into a production environment continues to be a complex task. I made an article that will guide you through deploying some of the top LLMs, namely LLaMA 2 70B, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B, on AWS EC2. I employ an inference engine capable of batch processing and distributed inference: vLLM.
 vLLM will greatly aid in the implementation of LLaMA 2 and Mixtral because it allows us to use AWS EC2 instances equipped with multiple smaller GPUs (such as the NVIDIA A10) rather than relying on a single large GPU (like the NVIDIA A100 or H100).
 See the detailed how-to here: https://nlpcloud.com/deploy-llama-2-mistral-and-mixtral-on-aws-ec2-with-vllm.html
 In this tutorial I used AWS EC2 but I could have used other vendors of course. The main challenge is the cost of the GPUs and their availability.
 Please don&#x27;t hesitate to share feedbacks about this article, it will be very much appreciated!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I tried to implement Attention is all you need paper to train language models based on the Transformer architecture, but failing to train these models. The loss or perplexity for that matter, reduces to some extent, but than it becomes stagnant. I am running out of ideas here, like what could be the reason for that. To access the scripts click here. Any help in this regard is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.
 Cheers

 The data I have used is a plain text file which is not very large. But what I don&#x27;t know is whether the problem is that the data set is too small or that the information is not well structured. can anyone give me some guidance? 
 How should a plain text dataset be structured? And if I convert it to csv what structure should it have? Also, if I want to create a much bigger dataset with the chess rules theme, how can I do it? Thanks anyway

                              <span>We study the problem of stereo singing voice cancellation, a subtask of music source separation, whose goal is to estimate an instrumental background from a stereo mix. We explore how to achieve performance similar to large state-of-the-art source separation networks starting from a small, efficient model for real-time speech separation. Such a model is useful when memory and compute are limited and singing voice processing has to run with limited look-ahead. In practice, this is realised by adapting an existing mono model to handle stereo input. Improvements in quality are obtained by tuning…</span>

                              <span>If you’re doing computations on a GPU, NVIDIA is the default, alongside its CUDA libraries.
Some libraries like PyTorch support do support AMD GPUs and Macs.
But from the re-implementations of NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas in the RAPIDS project, to Numba’s GPU support, NVIDIA has best software support in the Python world.
Sticking to NVIDIA-specific software has some downsides, however:
It won’t run on modern Mac laptops.
Testing in CI is more difficult: you need custom runners that have NVIDIA GPUs.
You can’t use any other GPUs you might have access to, like AMD GPUs.
What can you do if you want to use GPUs in a portable manner?
In this article we’ll cover one option, the wgpu-py library.

                              <span>It is well known that batch inference is a common practice for efficient LLM serving (which is one primary reason why services like ChatGPT have an initial delay). This batching practice is motivated by the fact that inference latency is mostly limited by the I/O cost of model loading but not the actual compute, where serving multiple requests in a batched manner adds tolerable latency increase while bringing in massive savings on cost per token. However, one issue of batched inference (or long context tasks, or both) is the massive KV cache required. As illustrated in this previous paper by Jeff Dean: a 500B+ model with bs&#x3D;512 and seqlen&#x3D;2048 has a total KV cache about 3TB — this is 3 times the model weight and brings another I/O challenge as the GPU will need to load the entire KV cache …</span>

                              <span>I’d already written a post about my interest in choosing a master&#x27;s degree in computational linguistics. I&#x27;m actually still undecided whether to pursue the academic world in traditional linguistics or to delve into NLP and computational linguistics. For the master&#x27;s degree, I had already looked at the one in Language Technologies at Pisa and Konstanz ( Germany) and they both seemed really good until I saw the “Computational and Theoretical Modelling of Language and Cognition” course in Trento, which seems much, much better than the one in Pisa.
 I wanted to know in particular how is this MA, if it&#x27;s really as great as it seems, and especially how affordable it is for a student who doesn&#x27;t have a background in mathematics and computer science (I&#x27;ve only taken one statistics exam, but nothing too serious). I saw that the course doesn&#x27;t require programming or math knowledge, however, there are mandatory exams in Mathematics and Machine Learning, and I wanted to know how feasible these courses actually are, whether they are very mathematical or more practical without requiring basic knowledge. Also, is it possible to find a job in the field after graduation, does the university provide connections with companies for its students?

                              <span>Dear Google AI Team,
 As a supporter of Gemini Advanced, I understand the need for sustainable revenue models. Could a careful implementation of advertisements be a feasible solution? Here are some thoughts, emphasizing responsible integration:
 Contextual Emphasis: Focus on text-based ads directly related to conversation topics, ensuring relevancy for users. Limited and Unobtrusive: A small number of clearly marked ads in designated areas would minimize disruption to the user experience. Prioritizing User Needs: Gemini Advanced&#x27;s core task must remain providing helpful and unbiased information. Sponsored results, if utilized, should only appear when highly relevant and should be clearly distinguished from organic answers. I believe a mindful approach to ads could potentially create a viable revenue stream while safeguarding Gemini Advanced&#x27;s reputation as a reliable and trustworthy AI tool.
 Thank you for your consideration!
 Sincerely, Mehdi

                              <span>Hey folks, I am currently developing a Rasa Chatbot to conduct a survey and I am having some issues.
 The survey in question uses a Likert scale thought, meaning that the answers to the vast majority of questions are &quot;strongly agree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot; and &quot;strongly disagree&quot;. I am using the &quot;forms&quot; with each of my questions having its own &quot;slot&quot;. The issue that I am having is that because all of the questions have the same responses the chatbot doesn&#x27;t know from content which answer applies to each question, I am unsure if my understanding of Rasa is flawed or if I am missing something but I don&#x27;t know how I should go about fixing this.
 I&#x27;m aware this is a long shot but if anyone has any ideas or suggestions they would be much appreciated, I have added some of the code that …</span>

What is the best model to predict column headers using column values? How do I approach this task in a step by step manner?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a suitable algorithm to predict whether a customer will purchase an item or not based on a set of features. The output is binary - either 0 (no purchase) or 1 (purchase). The goal is to get the highest possible percentage of correct predictions
 Some additional info
  
There&#x27;s an significant amount of available features, up to 50 different ones. 
 
There&#x27;s an abundance of labeled data - close to a million entries that can be utilized
 
Only 1% of the entries have are purchased (minority class), the remaining 99% aren&#x27;t (majority class), meaning there is an imbalance.
 
 I&#x27;m providing a sample below with only part of the features.
  
 item name customer GEO customer gender device type OS customer age Employed Annual Income Married Has Children Purchased Item? 
  
 Vacuum Cleaner XYZ USA Female PC Windows 45 Yes 200k Yes Yes No 
 
 Please advise as to what type of alghorithm to utilize for this scenario, that are likely to have the highest % of accurate predictions.

                              <span>In most style transfer models I have seen, there is no target image but rather an image classifier network that uses internal features learned which is used to identify the style of each image. The training error is calculated by checking if the new image learns the same features of the 2 input kmages. What if I was to create a synthetic data that contained the target image that both styles mixed would output to. What should I use as loss function here? MSE? I read somewhere that it doesn&#x27;t work well. What other loss functions can be best used in the case where the target images are provided and output of the model should match the target image?

                              <span>I found a thread from a few years back that was saying yes because they are easier/cheaper to implement and even may perform better when there are fewer features with little interaction between them. 
 I was wondering if that&#x27;s still true in 2024.

 So I have a CSV file with transcripts which is text and the each transcript has a rating from 1-5 (this can be used as training data). I have another CSV with transcripts but no ratings. I want to be able to predict the ratings. What model do you suggest for something like this or how do you suggest I go about this? Thank you so much for you help!

                              <span>Can someone tell me their own experience, especially about finding a job after a degree in Language technology / computational linguistics ?
 I am about to graduate in a three-year course in foreign languages and literatures, I have taken various linguistics exams and am currently working on a thesis in historical linguistics. I have a great passion for linguistics and have become particularly interested in computational linguistics. At the moment, my professor of historical linguistics is very interested in me and has asked me to stay, not to leave, and always talks to me, even if not explicitly, about pursuing a Ph.D. in the future. Therefore, the choice was between staying at my university and continuing with the faculty of languages and cultures of Asia with a specialization in historical linguistics with the possibility of taking 3-4 courses in computational linguistics, or attending the university for NLP and computational linguistics in Germany at Konstanz or Tubingen, as they seem to be the only ones that accept students who do not have a background in computer science and do not require too much basic knowledge.
 I was wondering what the job prospects are after this degree, are there many job opportunities? Do these two programs (Konstanz / Tubingen) manage to easily place students in the workforce?
 Since I doubt that with just a few computational linguistics exams from my university I will really be able to find a job in these fields.&quot;

                              <span>Hey Reddit community,
 ​
 My college project team consisting of two members is working on developing a Chrome extension aimed at filtering out hateful speech and negative comments encountered by users while surfing the web. Our goal is to create a tool that promotes a more positive online experience for users.
 Details:
 Functionality: Our extension will monitor the websites users visit in real-time. When it detects any content containing hateful speech or negative comments, it will automatically hide or filter out such content from the user&#x27;s view.
 Feasibility: While we&#x27;re excited about this project, we&#x27;re also mindful of its feasibility. As two members, we want to ensure that the scope of the project is manageable within the given timeframe and resources. We&#x27;re open to any suggestions or advice on how to approach the development process efficiently.
 Technical Considerations: We&#x27;re particularly interested in insights on the technical aspects of building such an extension. Should we focus on specific programming languages or frameworks? Are there any existing libraries or APIs that could assist us in detecting and filtering out negative content effectively?
 Ethical Concerns: Additionally, we&#x27;re aware of the ethical implications of content moderation. How can we strike a balance between filtering harmful content and respecting freedom of expression? Are there any best practices or guidelines we should adhere to in this regard?
 Any advice, tips, or resources you can provide would be greatly appreciated. We&#x27;re eager to learn and make meaningful contributions with this project. Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>I wrote a rule-based text classification app specialized in my language (Vietnamese) and would like to know where else this app is useful. For example if you input the prompt (which is use a bunch of keywords), e.g. fish 50k, then it will automatically label/classify the prompt like this: - Object: fish - Type of Object: food - Place of transaction: market - Type of place of transaction: offline - Consumer: myself - Type of consumer: myself - Price: 50000 VND
 The program can make this classification based on a config you declare, e.g.: yaml - Dimension name: Object Classification: - Food: fish, meat - Appliance: computer, speaker Default value: meat ... 
 Which problems do you see this app will be useful? In general, where have you seen rule-based text classification being applied? Especially in the context of ChatGPT and its GPT store? I think rule-based classification is much cheaper and more accurate than statistical-based classification. Is that correct?

                              <span>I&#x27;m excited to share that I&#x27;m diving into my first big natural language processing project focused on analyzing feedback related to the appraisal of real estate properties. I&#x27;ll be working with Dutch text and aiming to classify various aspects of feedback to improve property evaluation processes.
 Here&#x27;s a (translated) sample text I&#x27;ll be working with:
 &quot;I believe the appraisal of my appartment is excessively high, particularly when compared to recent sales in our neighborhood. Additionally, the apartments you&#x27;ve selected as comparables for my unit are not suitable matches. I kindly request that you reassess the valuation.&quot;
 For this project, I&#x27;ve identified several key classifications (around 20) that the model needs to detect, in the above text it should for example find the following classifications.
  
Appraisal too high
 Comparison with neighbourhood
 Properties used for appraisal not similar
  
To tackle this task, I&#x27;m considering starting with a pre-trained multilingual model like BERT-multilingual and fine tuning it with a dataset I&#x27;ve classified by hand. However, I&#x27;m open to suggestions and would love to hear your thoughts if you&#x27;ve worked on similar projects or have insights into the best approaches for classifying (Dutch) text in NLP. If you know of any similar projects online that would be very helpful as well! I&#x27;ll be using Python for the implementation since I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of image classification tasks using Python and Tensorflow before.
 Any tips about wether to classify it sentence by sentence or the full text at once, how I could best go about this or any other helpful advice is very welcome!

                              <span>Hey Reddit community,
 ​
 My college project team consisting of two members is working on developing a Chrome extension aimed at filtering out hateful speech and negative comments encountered by users while surfing the web. Our goal is to create a tool that promotes a more positive online experience for users.
 Details:
 Functionality: Our extension will monitor the websites users visit in real-time. When it detects any content containing hateful speech or negative comments, it will automatically hide or filter out such content from the user&#x27;s view.
 Feasibility: While we&#x27;re excited about this project, we&#x27;re also mindful of its feasibility. As two members, we want to ensure that the scope of the project is manageable within the given timeframe and resources. We&#x27;re open to any suggestions or advice on how to approach the development process efficiently.
 Technical Considerations: We&#x27;re particularly interested in insights on the technical aspects of building such an extension. Should we focus on specific programming languages or frameworks? Are there any existing libraries or APIs that could assist us in detecting and filtering out negative content effectively?
 Ethical Concerns: Additionally, we&#x27;re aware of the ethical implications of content moderation. How can we strike a balance between filtering harmful content and respecting freedom of expression? Are there any best practices or guidelines we should adhere to in this regard?
 Any advice, tips, or resources you can provide would be greatly appreciated. We&#x27;re eager to learn and make meaningful contributions to this project. Thanks in advance for your help!

The objective is to perform sentiment analysis and produce insights on positive,neutral,negative reviews. I am unable to decide whether I should: 1. Simply use the rating column to get sentiment(pos/neu/neg) and then start getting insights? May or may not train a supervised training model. 2. Go via the route of an unsupervised setting using these reviews and then analyse which were identified as pos/neu/neg

                              <span>Been searching the web for a few days now and have been unable to find the exact problem name and definition, so I’m turning to the experts. 
 I have some documents of text and want to find the relevant sections of the text related to some key word or words. For example, say the document is about practical steps for how to take care of the pooping habits of common pets, and I search “dog” or “canine”. I’d like to get all sections of the text (there could be multiple) related to this discussion for dogs. Note that the text is fundamentally about taking care of animals pooping, not about animals themselves, so there could be parts of text relevant for dogs without the direct mention of them (likely around the sections where there is direct mention of them, but not always). Also note that by searching canine, I’d like to more or less get the same return as searching dog, even though the term is less commonly used. This second problem seems not nearly as hard, given both terms have very similar semantic meaning. The first is trickier given the model must understand relations and properties of the searched entity. 
 Another example could be searching for “Donald Trump” in a news article about recent developments in republican candidates’ campaigns and how the party currently fairs against the democrats. It would be nice to get all discussions of Trump but also segments about how republicans are doing versus democrats since this is relevant for Trump. 
 What is this problem called exactly? I’ve toyed around using a GPT and it yields reasonable results with the right prompts but perhaps there are more direct approaches.

Für mein Examen im Fach Französisch führe ich eine Sprachuntersuchung durch zu prädikativen bzw. nicht prädikativen Adjektiven. Ich muss nun herausfinden, ob sich folgende Adjektive (in den Beispielen), von denen ich vermute, es seien ausschließlich nicht prädikative Adjektive, sich möglicherweise doch prädikativ verwenden lassen... Könnte ich hierzu ein muttersprachliches Urteil zur Korrektheit dieser Sätze bekommen? Die Sätze habe ich so geformt, dass eine prädikative Verwendung der Adjektive vorliegt.
 - l&#x27;autorité et la confiance sont possibles
 - l&#x27;effort et la lassitude sont physiques .
 - l&#x27;épouvante et la stupeur sont générales
 -l&#x27;équité et l&#x27;égalité sont absolues
 - le paca et le porc-épic sont alongées
 - leur coeur et leur cerveau sont pareils - le coeur est pareil?
 -la rancune et la haine sont éternelles
 -une puissance et une étendue sont égales - la puissance est égal?
 -la mortification et la fuite sont continuelles
 -l&#x27;oppression et la tristesse sont extrêmes
 -la religion et l&#x27; humanité sont inférieures (minderwertig)
 Funktionieren diese Sätze in dieser Schreibart wirklich?
 Über eine Rückmeldung wäre ich allen französischen Muttersprachlern sehr dankbar!!!

                              <span>Help!
 This is my first post on Reddit
 I am thinking about using the variational autoencoder model for anomaly detection . I have an Android Logs dataset. As the logs generated are a representative of time series type of data I thought about using the VAEs with an architecture involving LSTMs in the encoder and decoders. As far as what I know about the basics of the working of the autoencoder models , given a sequence size say n , during learning/training phase n-1 entries are used to generate a representation/prediction of the nth entry (log in this case) and then reconstruction error is minimized by the model.
 How could I approach ? Please suggest if there are mistakes in my approach. I was also thinking about converting the logs into word embeddings using Word2Vec and then using them as input for the VAE model.
 Please suggest latest techniques and tools that I must consider exploring and a sample approach to get started with for high accuracy in this situation.
 I&#x27;m seeking feedback on this approach. Do you spot any potential flaws or have suggestions for improvements? I&#x27;m open to any insights or experiences you can share!
 Looking forward to your input. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a digital marketer and our company uses Chorus.ai to record/transcribe sales calls. What I&#x27;d like to do is essentially export as many sales calls as possible and identify pain points, problems, objections, etc. to better inform our marketing material. The ultimate goal is to quantify some of the qualitative data we have. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about doing this with a combination of keywords (that we&#x27;ve identified and that possibly an AI tool could identify for us) + other AI tools out there to scrape/analyze 100+ calls. As I’m looking into this more I think ‘coding’ for themes is what I likely am trying to do.
 Any resources/tools for how to start doing this? The call transcripts are private company data and so using something like Chat GPT won&#x27;t cut it due to privacy concerns.

                              <span>For example, I have a word in a text sequence that is &quot;patterns&quot; as in &quot;The patterns were very pretty.&quot; In the original character-wise label sequence, only &quot;pattern&quot; is labeled and the &quot;s&quot; isn&#x27;t. When we tokenize &quot;patterns&quot; using a pre-trained BERT tokenizer, the result is pat, ##tern, ##s.
 I&#x27;m trying to adjust the labels using the offsets_mapping that is returned by the tokenizer, but that leads to the problem that only pat and ##tern are labeled and ##s isn&#x27;t.
 My question is, if we have labels that don&#x27;t span the entire word and stop mid-subword, does that lead to performance problems?

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to compare how government strategy and attitudes towards ageing poulations has evolved over time, and how they differ across a handful of European countries. 
 The idea would be to take a handful of government policy whitepapers that address the ageing population challenge; and then extract the most common &#x27;words&#x27; or &#x27;themes&#x27; for each document, and then cluster together policies and strategy based on similarity scores. 
 First thoughts around this would be to use TFIDF to identify important keywords for each specific whitepaper. I&#x27;d then use a word embeddings model like BERT to calculate measures of pairwise cosine similarity between documents, enabling me to cluster them in to groups. This would help to generate insight into which governments have similar strategies. 
 To look at how this attitudes and strategy have evolved over time, i&#x27;d then probably look to build separate models each year. 
 I wondered if anybody had any other ideas around this? Would be interesting to see if its possible to use a topic modelling approach like LDA or BERTopic to extract latent themes in each whitepaper instead. I wasnt sure if its possible to do this using only a few documents. In this particular case i&#x27;d only have a few whitepapers to work with (one per country per year) 
 Open to any creative ideas!

                              <span>Hey guys, I just published the developer version of NanoDL, a library for developing transformer models within the Jax/Flax ecosystem and would love your feedback!
 Key Features of NanoDL include:
 A wide array of blocks and layers, facilitating the creation of customised transformer models from scratch.
 An extensive selection of models like LlaMa2, Mistral, Mixtral, GPT3, GPT4 (inferred), T5, Whisper, ViT, Mixers, GAT, CLIP, and more, catering to a variety of tasks and applications.
 Data-parallel distributed trainers so developers can efficiently train large-scale models on multiple GPUs or TPUs, without the need for manual training loops.
 Dataloaders, making the process of data handling for Jax/Flax more straightforward and effective.
 Custom layers not found in Flax/Jax, such as RoPE, GQA, MQA, and SWin attention, allowing for more flexible model development.
 GPU/TPU-accelerated classical ML models like PCA, KMeans, Regression, Gaussian Processes etc., akin to SciKit Learn on GPU.
 Modular design so users can blend elements from various models, such as GPT, Mixtral, and LlaMa2, to craft unique hybrid transformer models.
 A range of advanced algorithms for NLP and computer vision tasks, such as Gaussian Blur, BLEU etc.
 Each model is contained in a single file with no external dependencies, so the source code can also be easily used.
 Checkout the repository for sample usage and more details: https://github.com/HMUNACHI/nanodl
 Ultimately, I want as many opinions as possible, next steps to consider, issues, even contributions.
 Note: I am working on the readme docs. For now, in the source codes, I include a comprehensive example on top of each model file in comments.

                              <span>In my understanding, there are two types of approaches in NLP: rule-based and statistic-based. Rule-based approach is simple, understandable and need not training, while statistic-based is better if the rules are complex and you have good training data.
 What domains, fields or industries have the need to use rule-based approach classification problems? I think there should be a review on how this technique is applied in various field, but I can&#x27;t find one.
 My goal: I develop a rule-based classification tool for my language and now I&#x27;m looking for potential users. I want to know their needs and the insights of their fields.

                              <span>Hello Redditors!
 I&#x27;ve spent some time looking at instruction-tuning (aka LLM Alignment / Fine-Tuning) datasets and I&#x27;ve found that they inevitably have bad data lurking within them. This is often what’s preventing LLMs to go from demo to production, not more parameters/GPUs… However, bad instruction-response data is hard to detect manually.
 Applying our techniques below to the famous dolly-15k dataset immediately reveals all sorts of issues in this dataset (even though it was carefully curated by over 5000 employees): responses that are inaccurate, unhelpful, or poorly written, incomplete/vague instructions, and other sorts of bad language (toxic, PII, …)
 Data auto-detected to be bad can be filtered from the dataset or manually corrected. This is the fastest way to improve the quality of your existing instruction tuning data and your LLMs!
 Feel free to check out the code on Github to reproduce these findings or read more details here in our article which demonstrates automated techniques to catch low-quality data in any instruction tuning dataset.

 ​
 My question: as people who know a lot more about the NLP landscape than I do, who are the people you consider to be the most impressive minds in the field and why?
 ​
 Any opinions would be amazing. Thank you!

Objects and their relationships are ubiquitous in the world around us, and relationships can be as important to understanding an object as its own attributes viewed in isolation — take for example transportation networks, production networks, knowledge graphs, or social networks. Discrete mathematics and computer science have a long history of formalizing such networks as graphs, consisting of nodes connected by edges in various irregular ways. Yet most machine learning (ML) algorithms allow only for regular and uniform relations between input objects, such as a grid of pixels, a sequence of words, or no relation at all. 




Graph neural networks, or GNNs for short, have emerged…</span>

Time-series forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the M5 competition).



At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, retrieval-augmented generation, and code completion. Thes…</span>

Machine learning models in the real world are often trained on limited data that may contain unintended statistical biases. For example, in the CELEBA celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting “blond” as the hair color for most female faces — here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as medical diagnosis. 





Surprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to amplify such statistical biases, through the so-called simplicity bias of deep learning. T…</span>

These models are inspired by their textual counterparts, i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs), and exhibit similar scaling properties. Specifically, we highlight two key findings: (1) the performance of the visual features scale with both the model capacity and the quantity of data, (2) the value of the objective function correlates with the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We illustrate the practical implication of these findings by pre-training a 7 billion parameter AIM on 2…</span>

Text-to-image diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, and Imagen). While recent advancements in inference solutions on Android via MediaPipe and iOS via Core ML have been made in the past year, rapid (sub-second) text-to-image generation on mobile devices has remained out of reach.
 

To that end, in “MobileDiffusion: Subsecond Text-to-Image Generation on Mobile Devices”, we introduce a novel approach with the potential for rapid text-to-image generation on…</span>

                              <span>Abstract
Decision-making systems based on AI and machine learning
have been used throughout a wide range of real-world
scenarios, including healthcare, law enforcement, education,
and finance. It is no longer far-fetched to envision a future
where autonomous systems will drive entire business decisions
and, more broadly, support large-scale decision-making
infrastructure to solve society’s most challenging problems.
Issues of unfairness and discrimination are pervasive when
decisions are being made by humans, and remain (or are potentially
amplified) when decisions are made using machines
with little transparency, accountability, and fairness. In this
monograph, we introduce a framework for causal fairness
analysis with the intent of filling in this gap, i.e., understanding,
modeling, and possibly solving issues of fairness
in decision-making settings.
The main insight of our approach will be to link the quantification
of the disparities present in the observed data
with the underlying, often unobserved, collection of causal
mechanisms that generate the disparity in the first place, 
a challenge we call the Fundamental Problem of Causal
Fairness Analysis (FPCFA). In order to solve the FPCFA,
we study the problem of decomposing variations and empirical
measures of fairness that attribute such variations
to structural mechanisms and different units of the population.
Our effort culminates in the Fairness Map, the first
systematic attempt to organize and explain the relationship
between various criteria found in the literature. Finally, we
study which causal assumptions are minimally needed for
performing causal fairness analysis and propose the Fairness
Cookbook, which allows one to assess the existence of
disparate impact and disparate treatment.

If you’re writing numeric Python code, Numba can be a great way to speed up your program.
By compiling a subset of Python to machine code, Numba lets you write for loops and other constructs that would be too slow in normal Python.
In other words, it’s similar to Cython, C, or Rust, in that it lets you write compiled extensions for Python.
Numba code isn’t always as fast as it could be, however.
This is where profiling is useful: it can find at least some of the bottlenecks in your code.
In this article we’ll cover:
Profila, a new profiler I’ve released that is specifically designed for Numba code.
The limits of profiling.
There are many potential performance enhancements that a profiler can’t and won’t help you discover.

                              <span>Recent advances in deep learning and automatic speech recognition (ASR) have enabled the end-to-end (E2E) ASR system and boosted its accuracy to a new level. The E2E systems implicitly model all conventional ASR components, such as the acoustic model (AM) and the language model (LM), in a single network trained on audio-text pairs. Despite this simpler system architecture, fusing a separate LM, trained exclusively on text corpora, into the E2E system has proven to be beneficial. However, the application of LM fusion presents certain drawbacks, such as its inability to address the domain…</span>

In this work, we propose a novel architecture to efficiently detect arbitrary keywords based on an audio-compliant text encoder, which inherently has homogeneous representation with audio embedding, and it is also much smaller than a compatible text encoder.

To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster the learning of DDPs through a collbaborative ML model…</span>

AI-driven technologies are weaving themselves into the fabric of our daily routines, with the potential to enhance our access to knowledge and boost our overall productivity. The backbone of these applications lies in large language models (LLMs).  LLMs are memory-intensive and typically require specialized hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver tens of exaflops of computing power. This blog post shows how we can start addressing the computational challenges by utilizing memory more effectively.



The bulk of an LLM’s memory and compute are consumed by weights in matrix multiplication operations. Using narrower data types reduces memory consumption. For example, storing weights in the 8-bit integer (i.e., U8 or S8)…</span>

However, such brute force is not required. In practice, simple substitution ciphers are breakable by hand in a few […]

   Paper


tl;dr: When training large-scale models, standard practice is to select training data that is intuitively useful. However, it turns out that such data can actually hurt model performance. We instead design a framework that selects by modeling how models learn from data—and thereby greatly improve performance.
Suppose we want to train a large-scale ML model, like a language model or a diffusion model. How do we choose which data to train on? Standard methods tend to select data using human notions of data quality. For example, the GPT-3 training procedure selects training data that matches intuitively “high quality” data sources like Wikipedia. Filtering like this yields (qualitatively) clean data that feels like it should improve model performance. But does it actually i…</span>

Graphs, in which objects and their relations are represented as nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) between pairs of nodes, are ubiquitous in computing and machine learning (ML). For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. 




A common approach to learning on graphs are graph neural networks (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a message-passing framework,…</span>

                              <span>Two salient limitations have long hindered the relevance of optimal transport methods to machine learning. First, the  computational cost of standard sample-based solvers (when used on batches of  samples) is prohibitive. Second, the mass conservation constraint makes OT solvers too rigid in practice: because they must match \textit{all} points from both measures, their output can be heavily influenced by outliers. A flurry of recent works has addressed these computational and modeling limitations. Still it has resulted in two separate strains of methods: While the computational outlook was…</span>

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, making the longitudinal monitoring of cardiovascular biomarkers vital for early diagnosis and intervention. A core challenge is the inference of cardiac pulse parameters from pulse waves, especially when acquired from wearable sensors at peripheral body locations. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches face hurdles in this context due to the scarcity of labeled data, primarily sourced from clinical settings. Simultaneously, physical…</span>

The Transformer architecture has two main non-embedding components: Attention and the Feed Forward Network (FFN). Attention captures interdependencies between words regardless of their position, while the FFN non-linearly transforms each input token independently. In this work, we explore the role of FFN and find that despite, and find that despite taking up a significant fraction of the model&#x27;s parameters, it is highly redundant. Concretely, we are able to substantially reduce the number of parameters with only a modest drop in accuracy by…</span>

However, existing NeRF+SR methods increase training overhead by using extra input features, loss functions, and/or expensive training procedures such as knowledge distillation. In this paper, we aim to leverage SR for efficiency gains without costly training or architectural changes. Specifically, we build a simple NeRF+SR pipeline that directly combines existing modules, and we propose a lightweight augmentation…</span>

Aggregated predictors are obtained by making a set of basic
predictors vote according to some weights, that is, to some
probability distribution. Randomized predictors are obtained
by sampling in a set of basic predictors, according to some
prescribed probability distribution.
Thus, aggregated and randomized predictors have in common
that their definition rely on a probability distribution on
the set of predictors. In statistical learning theory, there is a
set of tools designed to understand the generalization ability
of such predictors: PAC-Bayesian or PAC-Bayes bounds.
Since the original PAC-Bayes bounds (Shawe-Taylor and
Williamson, 1997; McAllester, 1998), these tools have been
considerably improved in many directions. We will for example
describe a simplified version of the localization technique
(Catoni, 2003; Catoni, 2007) that was missed by the
community, and later rediscovered as “mutual information
bounds”. Very recently, PAC-Bayes bounds received a considerable
attention. There was workshop on PAC-Bayes at
NIPS 2017, (Almost) 50 Shades of Bayesian Learning: PACBayesian
trends and insights, organized by B. Guedj, F. Bach and P. Germain. 
One of the reasons of this recent interest
is the successful application of these bounds to neural
networks (Dziugaite and Roy, 2017). Since then, this is a
recurring topic of workshops in the major machine learning
conferences.
The objective of these notes is to provide an elementary
introduction to PAC-Bayes bounds.

In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with machines, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation to unprecedented heights. Yet, the leap into high-stakes decision-making applications remains a chasm too wide, primarily due to the inherent uncertainty of model predictions. Traditional LLMs generate responses recursively, yet they lack an intrinsic mechanism to assign a confidence score to these responses. Although one can derive a confidence score by summing up the probabilities of individual tokens in the sequence, traditional approaches typically fall short in reliably dist…</span>

                              <span>Do you use NumPy, Pandas, or scikit-learn and want to get faster results?
Nvidia has created GPU-based replacements for each of these with the shared promise of extra speed.
For example, if you visit the front page of NVidia’s RAPIDS project, you’ll see benchmarks showing cuDF, a GPU-based Pandas replacement, is 15× to 80× faster than Pandas!
Unfortunately, while those speed-ups are impressive, they are also misleading.
GPU-based libraries might be the answer to your performance problems… or they might be an an unnecessary and expensive distraction.

On such tests, these models are at times said to reach human-level performance. However, there is one test that humans can pass but every AI method known to have been tried has abysmally failed.
