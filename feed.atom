While federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising approach to train machine learning models, it is limited to only preliminary explorations in the domain of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Moreover, FL does not inherently guarantee user privacy and requires the use of differential privacy (DP) for robust privacy guarantees. However, we are not aware of prior work on applying DP to FL for ASR. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by formulating an ASR benchmark for FL with DP and establishing the first baselines. First, we extend the existing…]]></summary>

In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when estimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein distance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the population mass is. In this work we study differentially private density estimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal algorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.

Locally differentially private algorithms require little trust but are (provably) limited in their utility. Centrally differentially private algorithms can allow significantly better utility but require a trusted curator. This gap has led to significant interest in the design and implementation of simple cryptographic primitives, that can allow central-like utility guarantees without having to trust a central server.

Large language models are versatile tools but are not suitable for small inference budgets. Small models have more efficient inference but their lower capacity means that their performance can be good only if one limits their scope to a specialized domain. This paper explores how to get a small language model with good specialized accuracy, even when specialization data is unknown during pretraining. We propose a novel architecture, projected networks (PN). PN is a high capacity network whose parameters…]]></summary>

Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as…]]></summary>

The theorem, known as the polar factorization theorem, states that any field FFF can be recovered as the composition of the gradient of a convex function uuu with a measure-preserving map MMM, namely F=∇u∘MF=\nabla u \circ MF=∇u∘M.

In this work, we show that the neurons responsible for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AURA), an intervention that can be applied to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity.

On top of E2E systems, researchers have achieved substantial accuracy improvement by rescoring E2E model’s N-best hypotheses with a phoneme-based model. This raises an interesting question about where the improvements come from other than the system combination effect.

An omnipredictor for a class L of loss functions and a class C  of hypotheses is a predictor whose predictions incur less expected loss than the best hypothesis in C  for every loss in L. Since the work of [GKR+21] that introduced the notion, there has been a large body of work in the setting of binary labels where y∈{0,1}, but much less is known about the regression setting where y∈[0,1] can be continuous. Our main conceptual contribution is the notion of sufficient…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beyond minimizing a single training loss, many deep learning estimation pipelines rely on an auxiliary objective to quantify and encourage desirable properties of the model (e.g. performance on another dataset, robustness, agreement with a prior). Although the simplest approach to incorporating an auxiliary loss is to sum it with the training loss as a regularizer, recent works have shown that one can improve performance by blending the gradients beyond a simple sum; this is known as gradient surgery. We cast the problem as a constrained minimization problem where the auxiliary objective is…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts. Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to…]]></summary>

Still, our mathematical understanding of attention, in particular of its Lipschitz properties — which are key when it comes to analyzing robustness and expressive power — is incomplete. We provide a detailed study of the Lipschitz constant of self-attention in several practical scenarios, discussing the impact of the sequence length  and layer normalization on the local Lipschitz constant of both unmasked and masked self-attention.

Large, pre-trained models are problematic to use in resource constrained applications. Fortunately, task-aware structured pruning methods offer a solution. These approaches reduce model size by dropping structural units like layers and attention heads in a manner that takes into account the end-task. However, these pruning algorithms require more task-specific data than is typically available. We propose a framework which combines structured pruning with transfer learning to reduce…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of distribution locality to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the locality measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper was accepted at the Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations workshop at ACL 2024.
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, including mitigating harm in LLM outputs, enhancing text summarization, and mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces an RLAIF framework for improving the code generation abilities of lightweight (<1B parameters) LLMs. We specifically focus on code generation tasks that require writing appropriate API calls, which is challenging due to the well-known issue of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The inability to linearly classify XOR has motivated much of deep learning. We revisit this age-old problem and show that linear classification of XOR is indeed possible. Instead of separating data between halfspaces, we propose a slightly different paradigm, equality separation, that adapts the SVM objective to distinguish data within or outside the margin. Our classifier can then be integrated into neural network pipelines with a smooth approximation. From its properties, we intuit that equality separation is suitable for anomaly detection. To formalize this notion, we introduce closing…]]></summary>
