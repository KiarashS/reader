The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two sequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and generate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent tokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a bottleneck in the generation process. An open question…]]></summary>

Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (𝑅𝑅) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure 𝑅𝑅 (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies…]]></summary>

While federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising approach to train machine learning models, it is limited to only preliminary explorations in the domain of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Moreover, FL does not inherently guarantee user privacy and requires the use of differential privacy (DP) for robust privacy guarantees. However, we are not aware of prior work on applying DP to FL for ASR. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by formulating an ASR benchmark for FL with DP and establishing the first baselines. First, we extend the existing…]]></summary>

In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when estimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein distance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the population mass is. In this work we study differentially private density estimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal algorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.

Over the decades, AI researchers have developed Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret scenes within single images and answer related questions. While recent advancements in foundation models have significantly closed the gap between human and machine visual processing, conventional VQA has been restricted to reason about only single images at a time rather than whole collections of visual data.
This limitation poses challenges in more complex scenarios. Take, for example, the challenges of discerning patterns in collections of medical images, monitoring deforestation through satellite imagery, mapping urban changes using autonomous naviga…]]></summary>

Locally differentially private algorithms require little trust but are (provably) limited in their utility. Centrally differentially private algorithms can allow significantly better utility but require a trusted curator. This gap has led to significant interest in the design and implementation of simple cryptographic primitives, that can allow central-like utility guarantees without having to trust a central server.

Large language models are versatile tools but are not suitable for small inference budgets. Small models have more efficient inference but their lower capacity means that their performance can be good only if one limits their scope to a specialized domain. This paper explores how to get a small language model with good specialized accuracy, even when specialization data is unknown during pretraining. We propose a novel architecture, projected networks (PN). PN is a high capacity network whose parameters…]]></summary>

Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms.

A two-server system such as PRIO allows for scalable aggregation of secret-shared vectors. Adversarial clients might try to manipulate the aggregate, so it is important to ensure that each (secret-shared) contribution is well-formed. In this work, we focus on the important and well-studied goal of ensuring that each contribution vector has bounded Euclidean norm. Existing protocols for ensuring bounded-norm contributions either incur a large communication overhead, or only allow for…]]></summary>

The theorem, known as the polar factorization theorem, states that any field FFF can be recovered as the composition of the gradient of a convex function uuu with a measure-preserving map MMM, namely F=∇u∘MF=\nabla u \circ MF=∇u∘M.

In this work, we show that the neurons responsible for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AURA), an intervention that can be applied to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity. As the intervention is proportional to the ability of each neuron to discriminate toxic content, it is free of any model-dependent…]]></summary>

Furthermore, we show that the rotational extrinsics are observable while the scale factors can be determined up to global scale for general configurations of the gyroscopes.

On top of E2E systems, researchers have achieved substantial accuracy improvement by rescoring E2E model’s N-best hypotheses with a phoneme-based model. This raises an interesting question about where the improvements come from other than the system combination effect. We examine the underlying mechanisms driving these gains and propose an efficient joint training approach, where E2E models are trained jointly…]]></summary>

Although the simplest approach to incorporating an auxiliary loss is to sum it with the training loss as a regularizer, recent works have shown that one can improve performance by blending the gradients beyond a simple sum; this is known as gradient surgery.

Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality.

Large, pre-trained models are problematic to use in resource constrained applications. Fortunately, task-aware structured pruning methods offer a solution. These approaches reduce model size by dropping structural units like layers and attention heads in a manner that takes into account the end-task. However, these pruning algorithms require more task-specific data than is typically available. We propose a framework which combines structured pruning with transfer learning to reduce…]]></summary>
