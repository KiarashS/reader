          "description": "A series of regression instances in a pharmaceutical application. Can we learn how to set the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) from similar domain-specific data? Overview. Perhaps the simplest relation between a real dependent variable \\(y\\) and a vector of features \\(X\\) is a linear model \\(y = \\beta X\\). Given some training examples or datapoints consisting of pairs of features and dependent variables \\((X_1, y_1),(X_2, y_2),\\dots,(X_m,y_m)\\), we would like to learn \\(\\beta\\) which would give the best prediction \\(y’\\) given features \\(X’\\) of an unseen example. This process of fitting a linear model \\(\\beta\\) to the datapoints is called linear regression. This simple yet effective model finds ubiquitous applications, ranging from biological, behavioral, and social sciences to environmental studies and financial forecasting, to make reliable predictions on future data. In ML terminology, linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm with low variance and good generalization properties. It is much less data-hungry than typical deep learning models, and performs well even with small amounts of training data. Further, to avoid overfitting the model to the training data, which reduces the prediction performance on unseen data, one typically uses regularization, which modifies the objective function of the linear model to reduce impact of […]",

          "description": "Diffusion models have demonstrated strong results on image synthesis in past years. Now the research community has started working on a harder task—using it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of the image case, since an image is a video of 1 frame, and it is much more challenging because:\nIt has extra requirements on temporal consistency across frames in time, which naturally demands more world knowledge to be encoded into the model.",
