          "description": "TLDR; Design biases in NLP systems, such as performance differences for different populations, often stem from their creator’s positionality, i.e., views and lived experiences shaped by identity and background. Despite the prevalence and risks of design biases, they are hard to quantify because researcher, system, and dataset positionality are often unobserved. We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models. We find that datasets and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Additionally, certain groups such as nonbinary people and non-native English speakers are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Imagine the following scenario (see Figure 1): Carl, who works for the New York Times, and Aditya, who works for the Times of India, both want to use Perspective API. However, Perspective API fails to label instances containing derogatory terms in Indian contexts as “toxic”, leading it to work better overall for Carl than Aditya. This is because toxicity researchers’ positionalities lead them to make design choices that make toxicity datasets, and thus Perspective API, to have Western-centric positionalities. In this study, we developed NLPositionality, a framework to quantify […]",

In Gboard, LMs are used to improve users’ typing experience by supporting features like next word prediction (NWP), Smart Compose, smart completion and suggestion, slide to type, and proofread. Deploying models on users’ devices rather than enterprise servers has advantages like lower latency and better privacy for model usage. While training on-device models directly from user data effectively improves the utility performance for applications such as NWP and smart text selection, protecting the privacy of user data for model training is important. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGboard features powe…",

Often, models are trained on longitudinal data with the hope that the training data used will accurately represent inputs the model may receive in the future. More generally, the default assumption that all training data are equally relevant often breaks in practice. For example, the figure below shows images from the CLEAR nonstationary learning benchmark, and it illustrates how visual features of objects evolve significantly over a 10 year span (a phenomenon we refer to as slow concept drift), posing a challenge for object categorization models. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample ima…",

DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations.

This naturally led to an intense focus on models as the primary ingredient in AI application development, with everyone wondering what capabilities new LLMs will bring.\nAs more developers begin to build using LLMs, however, we believe that this focus is rapidly changing: state-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple components, not just monolithic models.\nFor example, Google’s AlphaCode 2 set state-of-the-art results in programming through a carefully engineered system that uses LLMs to generate up to 1 million possible solutions for a task and then filter down the set.
