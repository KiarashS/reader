However, pairwise similarity computation in contrastive loss between image and text pairs poses computational challenges.  This paper presents a novel weakly supervised pre-training of vision models on web-scale image-text data. The proposed method reframes pre-training on image-text data as a classification task. Consequently, it eliminates the need for pairwise similarity computations in contrastive loss, achieving a remarkable 2.7…",
