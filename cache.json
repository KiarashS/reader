          "description": "This paper introduces AIM, a collection of vision models pre-trained with an autoregressive objective. These models are inspired by their textual counterparts, i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs), and exhibit similar scaling properties. Specifically, we highlight two key findings: (1) the performance of the visual features scale with both the model capacity and the quantity of data, (2) the value of the objective function correlates with the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We illustrate the practical implication of these findings by pre-training a 7 billion parameter AIM on 2…",

The E2E systems implicitly model all conventional ASR components, such as the acoustic model (AM) and the language model (LM), in a single network trained on audio-text pairs. Despite this simpler system architecture, fusing a separate LM, trained exclusively on text corpora, into the E2E system has proven to be beneficial. However, the application of LM fusion presents certain drawbacks, such as its inability to address the domain…",
