This prestigious competition aims to revolutionize AI in mathematical problem-solving, with the ultimate goal of  building  a publicly-shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Dive into our blog to discover the winning formula that set us apart in this significant contest. Background: The AIMO competition The Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Prize, initiated by XTX Markets, is a pioneering competition designed to revolutionize AI’s role in mathematical problem-solving. It  pushes the boundaries of AI by solving  complex mathematical problems akin to those in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The advisory committee of AIMO includes Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao, both winners of the Fields Medal. Attracting attention from world-class mathematicians as well as machine learning researchers, the AIMO sets a new benchmark for excellence in the field. AIMO has introduced a series of progress prizes. The first of these was a Kaggle competition, with the 50 test problems hidden from competitors. The problems are comparable in difficulty to the AMC12 and AIME exams for the USA IMO […]",

For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token.

          "description": "Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts. Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the \"distraction phenomenon,\" where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to…",
