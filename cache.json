This prestigious competition aims to revolutionize AI in mathematical problem-solving, with the ultimate goal of  building  a publicly-shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Dive into our blog to discover the winning formula that set us apart in this significant contest. Background: The AIMO competition The Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Prize, initiated by XTX Markets, is a pioneering competition designed to revolutionize AI’s role in mathematical problem-solving. It  pushes the boundaries of AI by solving  complex mathematical problems akin to those in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). The advisory committee of AIMO includes Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao, both winners of the Fields Medal. Attracting attention from world-class mathematicians as well as machine learning researchers, the AIMO sets a new benchmark for excellence in the field. AIMO has introduced a series of progress prizes. The first of these was a Kaggle competition, with the 50 test problems hidden from competitors.

Small models have more efficient inference but their lower capacity means that their performance can be good only if one limits their scope to a specialized domain. This paper explores how to get a small language model with good specialized accuracy, even when specialization data is unknown during pretraining. We propose a novel architecture, projected networks (PN). PN is a high capacity network whose parameters…",

Over the decades, AI researchers have developed Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret scenes within single images and answer related questions. While recent advancements in foundation models have significantly closed the gap between human and machine visual processing, conventional VQA has been restricted to reason about only single images at a time rather than whole collections of visual data.\nThis limitation poses challenges in more complex scenarios. Take, for example, the challenges of discerning patterns in collections of medical images, monitoring deforestation through satellite imagery, mapping urban changes using autonomous naviga…",
