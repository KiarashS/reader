          "description": "TLDR; Design biases in NLP systems, such as performance differences for different populations, often stem from their creator’s positionality, i.e., views and lived experiences shaped by identity and background. Despite the prevalence and risks of design biases, they are hard to quantify because researcher, system, and dataset positionality are often unobserved. We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models. We find that datasets and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Additionally, certain groups such as nonbinary people and non-native English speakers are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Imagine the following scenario (see Figure 1): Carl, who works for the New York Times, and Aditya, who works for the Times of India, both want to use Perspective API. However, Perspective API fails to label instances containing derogatory terms in Indian contexts as “toxic”, leading it to work better overall for Carl than Aditya. This is because toxicity researchers’ positionalities lead them to make design choices that make toxicity datasets, and thus Perspective API, to have Western-centric positionalities. In this study, we developed NLPositionality, a framework to quantify […]",

          "description": "This paper was accepted at the workshop HSCMA at ICASSP 2024.\nVoice triggering (VT) enables users to activate their devices by just speaking a trigger phrase. A front-end system is typically used to perform speech enhancement and/or separation, and produces multiple enhanced and/or separated signals. Since conventional VT systems take only single-channel audio as input, channel selection is performed. A drawback of this approach is that unselected channels are discarded, even if the discarded channels could contain useful information for VT. In this work, we propose multichannel acoustic…",

          "description": "AI caught everyone’s attention in 2023 with Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be instructed to perform general tasks, such as translation or coding, just by prompting. This naturally led to an intense focus on models as the primary ingredient in AI application development, with everyone wondering what capabilities new LLMs will bring.\nAs more developers begin to build using LLMs, however, we believe that this focus is rapidly changing: state-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple components, not just monolithic models.\nFor example, Google’s AlphaCode 2 set state-of-the-art results in programming through a carefully engineered system that uses LLMs to generate up to 1 million possible solutions for a task and then filter down the set.
