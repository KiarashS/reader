          "description": "Introduction A central question in the discussion of large language models (LLMs) concerns the extent to which they memorize their training data versus how they generalize to new tasks and settings. Most practitioners seem to (at least informally) believe that LLMs do some degree of both: they clearly memorize parts of the training data—for example, they are often able to reproduce large portions of training data verbatim [Carlini et al., 2023]—but they also seem to learn from this data, allowing them to generalize to new settings. The precise extent to which they do one or the other has massive implications for the practical and legal aspects of such models [Cooper et al., 2023]. Do LLMs truly produce new content, or do they only remix their training data? Should the act of training on copyrighted data be deemed an unfair use of data, or should fair use be judged by some notion of model memorization? When dealing with humans, we distinguish plagiarizing content from learning from it, but how should this extend to LLMs? The answer inherently relates to the definition of memorization for LLMs and the extent to which they memorize their training data. However, even defining memorization for LLMs […]",

Therefore, I think it may be helpful to present a more concentrated discussion on Orthogonality, contrasting Orthogonality with my own view, without introducing dependencies on Land's views. (Land gets credit for inspiring many of these thoughts, of course, but I'm presenting my views as my own here.)\nFirst, let's define the Orthogonality Thesis.

However, this method of training can fail to meaningfully control the probability of tail events that might cause significant harm. For instance, while an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant may be generally safe, it would be catastrophic if it ever suggested an action that resulted in unnecessary large-scale harm.\nCurrent techniques for estimating the probability of tail events are based on finding inputs on which an AI behaves catastrophically. Since the input space is so large, it might be prohibitive to search through it thoroughly enough to detect all potential catastrophic behavior.
