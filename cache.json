          "description": "Introduction A central question in the discussion of large language models (LLMs) concerns the extent to which they memorize their training data versus how they generalize to new tasks and settings. Most practitioners seem to (at least informally) believe that LLMs do some degree of both: they clearly memorize parts of the training data—for example, they are often able to reproduce large portions of training data verbatim [Carlini et al., 2023]—but they also seem to learn from this data, allowing them to generalize to new settings. The precise extent to which they do one or the other has massive implications for the practical and legal aspects of such models [Cooper et al., 2023]. Do LLMs truly produce new content, or do they only remix their training data? Should the act of training on copyrighted data be deemed an unfair use of data, or should fair use be judged by some notion of model memorization? When dealing with humans, we distinguish plagiarizing content from learning from it, but how should this extend to LLMs? The answer inherently relates to the definition of memorization for LLMs and the extent to which they memorize their training data. However, even defining memorization for LLMs […]",

You’re worried that this model is scheming, and you’re worried that it might only need to take a small number of actions to get to a dangerous and hard-to-reverse situation like exfiltrating its own weights. Problems like these that the AI can cause with small numbers of actions are particularly hard to address with standard safety techniques, because by default you are unlikely to notice the problem until the hard-to-reverse outcome has already occurred.\nOne of the main classes of techniques that you could apply in the hope of preventing these catastrophic actions is what we call untrusted moni…",

So I think it’s important to have a clear picture of how this kind of AI agent could work, and how it might be secured. I often talk to people who seem to have a somewhat confused picture of how this kind of agent setup would work that causes them to conflate some different versions of the threat model, and to miss some important points about which aspects of the system are easy or hard to defend.\nSo in this post, I’ll present a simple system architecture for a system where autonomous…",

However, this method of training can fail to meaningfully control the probability of tail events that might cause significant harm. For instance, while an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant may be generally safe, it would be catastrophic if it ever suggested an action that resulted in unnecessary large-scale harm.\nCurrent techniques for estimating the probability of tail events are based on finding inputs on which an AI behaves catastrophically. Since the input space is so large, it might be prohibitive to search through it thoroughly enough to detect all potential catastrophic behavior.

We examine the changing dynamics across different levels, including the growing difficulty of verifying alignment and the increasing disconnect between alignment and capabilities research. \nBy introducing the concept of High Impact Tasks (HITs) and discussing architectural influences on alignment, we are able to explain precisely what determines AI alignment difficulty.\nThis work wa…",

Part of our motivation for this is an analogy between backdoors and deceptive alignment, the possibility that an AI system would intentionally behave well in training in order to give itself the opportunity to behave uncooperatively later. In our paper, we prove several theoretical results that shed some light on possible mitigations for deceptive alignment, albeit in a way that is limited by the strength of this analogy.\nIn this post, we will:\nLay out the analogy between backdoors and deceptive alignment\nDiscuss prior theoretical results from the perspective of this analogy\nExplain our formal notion of backdoors…",

I'm not saying these are the only differences in what people mean by \"AGI alignment\".\nSummary: \nValue alignment is better but probably harder to achieve than personal intent alignment to the short-term wants of some person(s). Different groups and people tend to primarily address one of these alignment targets when they discuss alignment. Confusion abounds. \nOne important confusion stems from an assumption that the type of AI defines the alignment target: strong goal-directed AGI must be value aligned or misaligned, while personal intent alignment is only viable for relatively weak AI.
