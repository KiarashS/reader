Learning causal relationships from data is an important task across a wide variety of domains ranging from healthcare and drug development, to online advertising and e-commerce. As a result, there has been much work in the literature on economics, statistics, computer science, and public policy on designing algorithms and methodologies for causal inference. While most of the focus has been on questions which are statistical in nature, one must also take game-theoretic incentives into consideration when doing causal inference about strategic individuals who have a preference over the treatment they receive. For example, it may be hard to infer causal relationships in randomized control trials when there is non-compliance by participants in the study (i.e. when participants do not adhere to the treatment they are assigned). More generally, causal learning may be difficult whenever individuals are free to self-select their own treatments and there is sufficient heterogeneity between individuals with different preferences. Even when compliance can be enforced, individuals may strategize by modifying the attributes they present to the causal inference process in order to […]",

          "description": "Prompt engineering is an iterative procedure that often requires extensive manual efforts to formulate suitable instructions for effectively directing large language models (LLMs) in specific tasks. Incorporating few-shot examples is a vital and efficacious approach to provide LLMs with precise and tangible instructions, leading to improved LLM performance. Nonetheless, identifying the most informative demonstrations for LLMs is labor-intensive, frequently entailing sifting through an extensive search space. In this demonstration, we showcase an interactive tool called APE (Active Prompt…",
